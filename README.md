# Wearable-Haptic-braille-device-for-Blind
## Existing Problem 
Technological advances have enabled the development of various assistive solutions to aid
the visually impaired in their daily activities. One of the primary focus that continues to
persists is in developing an effective learning device that helps to not only read the
alphanumeric characters but also successfully read other spatial forms of learning such as
diagrams, signals and graphs especially in the science and engineering streams. Braille for
text in different formats including refreshable and portable devices are widely popular and
effective, but they are either not economical to the downtrodden family of students or limits
the use-case in the classroom setting. The real-time capability is not adhered, thereby the
visually impaired students are deprived of immersive learning in the classroom
environment. Although many refreshable braille devices are made available in the past
decade, however the context of the classroom board is still not mapped entirely to the
visually impaired students. The other constant challenge among the educators is expressing
spatially relevant information such as exponential and logarithmic expressions which are
either superscript or subscript in style to the impaired students.
## Overview
A novel wearable device that enables real-time haptic changes to reflect braille
representation of the classroom teaching including spatially relevant expressions and
diagrams around a learning workspace to provide a complete context aware classroom
board learning. The unique form of the device aids in easing the learning aspects in high
school and engineering levels thereby empowering the visually impaired students to take
up the science and engineering fields in the future.
## Goals and Objective
In STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education, student typically
comes across exponential or logarithmic functions or even integral expressions at various
times. Hence for comprehensive learning, one cannot ignore perceiving spatially located
alpha-numeric characters for visually impaired students. Hence a device to assist or at least
alert the blinds to move around the position is very beneficial.
The wearable haptic design to addresses the challenges faced by blind individuals in
reading and comprehending spatially distant written information.
